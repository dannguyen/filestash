# Dan Nguyen's filestash: a mirror of random files 

Just a place for me to upload random files that I want publicly accessible URLs to refer to.

The files are all in [files/](files/), and an informal listing w/ metadata is at [files/MANIFEST.yaml](files/MANIFEST.yaml).

Because this repo has Github Pages enabled, the files should be publicly accessible via URL like so:

https://dannguyen.github.io/filestash/files/FILE_NAME.XYZ

Or, alternatively:

https://github.com/dannguyen/filestash/raw/master/files/FILE_NAME.XYZ
